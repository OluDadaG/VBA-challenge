# VBA-challenge

#Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

#Before You Begin

Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge.
Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

# Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock. 
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

#Notes
In this assignment I used Stackflow to have an idea on the code for obtaining the greatest % increase and decrease.
